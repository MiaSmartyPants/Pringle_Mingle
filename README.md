Project Title
Pringle Mingle is a web application designed to help people meet as many people as they can during online events. Pringle Mingle transforms an hour-long, headache inducing sorting process of creating groups of people who have met each other the least, into seconds with a simple, user-friendly interface, combined with a sizeable, erudite database.
